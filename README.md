Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

#### Prerequisites

-   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v18 or later recommended)
-   [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) (Classic or Berry)
-   [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop/)

#### Setup Instructions

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/financial-ai-manager.git
    cd financial-ai-manager
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies:**
    This will install dependencies for all workspaces (client and server).
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

3.  **Configure Environment Variables:**
    Navigate to the server package and create a `.env` file.
    ```bash
    cd packages/server
    cp .env.example .env
    ```
    Now, open the new `.env` file and add your PostgreSQL database credentials and your Google Gemini API key.

4.  **Start the Database:**
    Make sure Docker Desktop is running. Then, from the project root, start the PostgreSQL container.
    ```bash
    docker-compose up -d
    ```

5.  **Seed the Database:**
    This command will create the necessary tables and populate them with initial sample data.
    ```bash
    yarn db:seed
    ```

6.  **Run the Application:**
    This will start both the backend server and the frontend development server concurrently.
    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```
    The application should now be running at `http://localhost:5173`.

## Usage

Once the application is running, you can start using it in two ways:

1.  **Connect to Database:**
    -   On the welcome screen, click the "Connect & Fetch Transactions" button.
    -   This will load the pre-seeded data into the application.
    -   You will be redirected to the main dashboard, where you can see the AI summary, charts, and transaction data.

2.  **Import a File:**
    -   On the welcome screen, select the "Import File" tab.
    -   Click to upload or drag-and-drop a `.csv` or `.xlsx` file containing your transactions.
    -   You will be taken to the "Review & Import" page. Here you can edit, delete, or deselect transactions before saving.
    -   Click "Save Selected to Database" to import the data and view the dashboard.

From there, you can navigate between the **Dashboard**, **Transactions**, and **Settings** pages to manage and analyze your financial data.
