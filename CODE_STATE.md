## Application State: v0.5.0 (AI Categorization Backend)

This document describes the state of the "Financial AI Manager" application after implementing the backend infrastructure for the AI-powered transaction categorization feature.

### Architecture

-   **Full-Stack Monorepo**: The project remains a Yarn Workspaces monorepo. The core application architecture is unchanged.

### Key Changes from v0.4.2

-   **GraphQL API Enhancement**: The backend API has been extended with a new `suggestCategories` mutation. This endpoint is designed to receive a list of uncategorized transactions and return AI-generated category suggestions.
-   **New Gemini Service Functionality**: A new function, `suggestTransactionCategories`, has been added to the server-side `geminiService`. It constructs a precise prompt and uses a strict JSON response schema to ensure reliable categorization suggestions from the Gemini API. This keeps all AI logic and the API key securely on the server.
-   **Resolver Implementation**: A new resolver connects the `suggestCategories` mutation to the database service (to fetch available categories) and the Gemini service, orchestrating the entire suggestion workflow.
-   **Frontend Readiness**: The backend is now fully prepared to support the upcoming frontend implementation of the AI categorization feature on the "Import" page.
