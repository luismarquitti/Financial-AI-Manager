## Application State: v0.4.2 (Local Dev Docs Enhancement)

This document describes the state of the "Financial AI Manager" application after significantly improving the local development setup and documentation.

### Architecture

- **Full-Stack Monorepo**: The project remains a Yarn Workspaces monorepo (`packages/client`, `packages/server`). The core application architecture is unchanged.

### Key Changes from v0.4.1

-   **`docker-compose.yml`**: A new `docker-compose.yml` file has been added to the project root. It defines a PostgreSQL service with a persistent named volume, ensuring a consistent and stable database environment for all developers.
-   **`docs/README.md`**: The technical documentation has been substantially updated. The "Local Development Setup" section now provides a much more detailed, step-by-step guide that is friendly to new contributors, especially those on Windows. It includes instructions for installing and verifying Docker, and a full explanation of the new `docker-compose.yml` configuration.
