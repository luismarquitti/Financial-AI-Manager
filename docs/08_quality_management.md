# 8. Software Quality Management

This section describes the processes and strategies in place to ensure the quality of the Financial AI Manager application.

### 8.1 Quality Assurance Process

Quality is a shared responsibility across the development lifecycle. The QA process involves several stages:

1.  **Static Code Analysis:**
    -   **Process:** Before any code is committed, it is automatically checked by TypeScript, ESLint, and Prettier. This is the first line of defense against bugs and inconsistencies.
    -   **Tools:** TypeScript Compiler (TSC), ESLint, Prettier.

2.  **Unit & Integration Testing:**
    -   **Process:** Developers are responsible for writing unit tests for their new code, covering business logic and component rendering. These tests are automatically run in the CI pipeline for every commit.
    -   **Tools:** Jest, React Testing Library.

3.  **Pull Request (PR) Code Reviews:**
    -   **Process:** Every feature or bug fix must be submitted as a pull request. At least one other team member must review the code for correctness, readability, adherence to standards, and test coverage before it can be merged into the `main` branch.
    -   **Tools:** GitHub / GitLab or similar version control platform.

4.  **Manual & Exploratory Testing:**
    > **[TODO]**: Formalize the manual testing process.
    -   **Process:** Before a major release, QA or another developer will perform exploratory testing on a staging environment to find bugs that automated tests may miss. This involves testing core user journeys and edge cases.
    -   **Environment:** A dedicated staging environment that mirrors production.

### 8.2 Risk Management

This section identifies potential risks to the project and outlines mitigation strategies.

| Risk ID | Risk Category          | Description                                                                                                                                     | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation Strategy                                                                                                                                                                |
| :------ | :--------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------- | :----- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| R-01    | **Technical Debt**     | Rushing features leads to suboptimal code, making future development slower and more error-prone.                                               | Medium     | Medium | - Enforce strict code reviews. <br/> - Regularly schedule time for refactoring. <br/> - Maintain high test coverage to enable safe refactoring.                                          |
| R-02    | **Security**           | A vulnerability in the application or its dependencies could lead to a data breach or unauthorized access.                                      | Low        | High   | - Store all secrets in a secure vault (e.g., Google Secret Manager). <br/> - Regularly update dependencies. <br/> - Implement security scanning in the CI/CD pipeline.            |
| R-03    | **External API Failure** | The Google Gemini API could become unavailable or introduce breaking changes, disabling the core AI analysis feature.                         | Low        | Medium | - Implement robust error handling and retry logic for API calls. <br/> - Gracefully degrade the UI, showing a message that the AI summary is unavailable, without crashing the app. |
| R-04    | **Data Loss**          | A catastrophic database failure or accidental deletion could result in permanent loss of user data.                                               | Low        | High   | - Use a managed database service (Cloud SQL) with automated daily backups and Point-in-Time Recovery enabled. <br/> - Regularly test the recovery process.                       |
| R-05    | **Performance Degradation**| As data volume grows, database queries or UI rendering could slow down, leading to a poor user experience.                                  | Medium     | Medium | - Add database indexes for frequently queried columns. <br/> - Implement pagination on all data tables. <br/> - Monitor application performance and set up latency alerts.              |
