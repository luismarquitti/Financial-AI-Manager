### 10.1 Modeling Notations

To ensure clarity and consistency, the following standard notations are used for diagrams within this documentation:

-   **Architectural & Data Flow Diagrams:**
    -   **Notation:** A simplified version of Data Flow Diagrams (DFD) and system context diagrams is used to represent high-level data flow and system interactions.
    -   **Tool:** Diagrams are specified using **Mermaid** syntax.
    -   **Location:** See [Section 3.1: Architectural Design](./03_design.md).

-   **Database Design:**
    -   **Notation:** Entity-Relationship (ER) diagrams using Crow's Foot notation are used to model database entities, attributes, and relationships.
    -   **Tool:** Diagrams are specified using **Mermaid** syntax.
    -   **Location:** See [Section 3.2: Database Design](./03_design.md).

-   **User Interaction Modeling:**
    -   **Notation:** Unified Modeling Language (UML) Use Case diagrams are used to model the interactions between the user and the system.
    -   **Tool:** Diagrams are specified using **Mermaid** syntax.
    -   **Location:** See [Section 2.3: User Interaction and Use Cases](./02_requirements.md).

### 10.2 Formal Methods

> **[TODO]**: The project does not currently employ formal methods for requirements specification or verification (e.g., Z notation, VDM). This section is a placeholder for future consideration if the application's complexity or criticality requires such rigor.
