### 11.1 Team Structure and Roles

> **[TODO]**: Define the specific team members and roles. The following is a template structure.

| Role                   | Responsibilities                                                                                                             |
| ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project Manager**    | Owns the product roadmap, prioritizes the backlog, and facilitates communication between stakeholders and the development team. |
| **Tech Lead / Architect** | Makes key architectural decisions, ensures code quality, mentors other developers, and oversees the technical implementation.    |
| **Software Engineer (Full-Stack)** | Develops features across the entire stack (frontend, backend, database), writes tests, and participates in code reviews. |
| **QA Engineer**        | Develops and executes test plans, manages bug reports, and oversees the overall quality of the application.                   |
| **DevOps Engineer**    | Manages the CI/CD pipeline, infrastructure, monitoring, and deployment processes.                                            |

### 11.2 Communication Plan

-   **Daily Stand-ups:** A brief daily meeting to discuss progress, plans for the day, and any impediments.
-   **Sprint Planning:** A meeting at the start of each sprint to define the sprint goal and select tasks from the backlog.
-   **Sprint Review:** A meeting at the end of each sprint to demonstrate completed work to stakeholders.
-   **Retrospectives:** A meeting at the end of each sprint for the team to reflect on what went well and what could be improved.
-   **Ad-hoc Communication:** Slack (or a similar tool) is used for real-time discussions and questions.

### 11.3 Ethical Considerations

-   **Data Privacy and Security:** The application handles sensitive personal financial data. It is ethically imperative to:
    -   Ensure all data is stored and transmitted securely.
    -   Never share user data with third parties without explicit consent.
    -   Be transparent about how the data is used (i.e., for generating AI summaries).
-   **AI Responsibility:** The AI-generated financial insights are suggestions, not professional financial advice.
    -   The UI must clearly state that the AI analysis is for informational purposes only and should not be the sole basis for financial decisions.
    -   The team must be aware of potential biases in the AI model and strive to provide fair and objective analysis.
